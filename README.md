# Employee Attrition Predict Project

## Introduction
In this project, we will address the task of binary classification using a tabular dataset related to employee attrition. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave (attrition) or stay within the organization based on various features and historical data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

1. Age: The age of the employee.
2. Gender: The gender of the employee.
3. Education: The highest level of education achieved by the employee.
4. Job Role: The current job role of the employee.
5. Department: The department in which the employee works.
6. Years at Company: The number of years the employee has been with the company.
7. Years in Current Role: The number of years the employee has been in the current role.
8. Years Since Last Promotion: The number of years since the employee's last promotion.
9. Years with Current Manager: The number of years the employee has had the current manager.
10. Monthly Income: The monthly income of the employee.
11. Work-Life Balance: Employee's self-reported work-life balance satisfaction.
12. Performance Rating: Employee's performance rating.
13. Number of Companies Worked: The number of companies the employee has worked for previously.
14. Distance from Home: The distance of the employee's home from the workplace.

## Methodology
Our approach to solving this binary classification problem involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (if any).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).

2. Feature Selection and Engineering:

Analyze feature importance to select relevant features.
Create new features if needed based on domain knowledge.

3. Model Selection:

Choose appropriate binary classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

4. Model Training:

Train the selected models on the training dataset.
Perform hyperparameter tuning if required using techniques like grid search or random search.

5. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Use confusion matrices to understand model predictions.

6. Model Interpretation:

Interpret the model results to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition.

7. Deployment:

If the model meets the performance criteria, deploy it for real-world predictions.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, we aim to develop a robust binary classification model that can accurately predict employee attrition. This model can be valuable for HR departments and organizations to proactively address attrition-related issues and improve employee retention.
