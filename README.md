# Employee Attrition Predict Project

## Introduction
In this project, we will address the task of binary classification using a tabular dataset related to employee attrition. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave (attrition) or stay within the organization based on various features and historical data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

- Age: Age of the individual.
- Education: Highest level of education attained by the individual.
- Education Field: Field or area of study for the individual's education.
- Gender: Gender of the individual.
- Marital Status: Marital status of the individual.
- Num Companies Worked: Number of companies the individual has worked for.
- Total Working Years: Total number of years the individual has worked in their career.

- Employee Number: Unique identification number for each employee.
- Training Time Last Year: Number of hours of training the employee received in the last year.
- Years at Company: Number of years the employee has been with the current company.
- Years in Current Role: Number of years the employee has been in their current role.
- Years since last Promotion: Number of years since the employee's last promotion.

- Daily Rate: The daily pay rate or salary of the employee.
- Hourly Rate: The hourly pay rate or salary of the employee.
- Monthly Income: The monthly income or salary of the employee.
- Monthly Rate: A monthly rate or salary-related metric.
- Stock Option Level: Level of stock options granted to the employee.
- Percent Salary Hike: The percentage increase in salary or wage.

- Department: The department within the company where the employee works.
- Business Travel: Frequency or nature of business-related travel undertaken by the employee.
- Distance from Home: The distance between the employee's home and the workplace.
- Job Level (1~5): The level or rank of the employee's job within the company (typically ranging from 1 to 5).
- Overtime: Whether the employee works overtime or not.
- Performance Rating: The employee's performance rating.
- Years with Current Manager: The number of years the employee has worked under the current manager.

- Environment Satisfaction: The level of satisfaction the employee has with their work environment.
- Job Involvement: The degree to which the employee is involved and engaged in their job.
- Job Satisfaction: The overall satisfaction the employee feels with their job.
- Relationship Satisfaction: The satisfaction level in terms of work-related relationships.
- Work-Life Balance: How balanced the employee perceives their work and personal life.

## Methodology
Our approach to solving this binary classification problem involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (if any).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).

2. Feature Selection and Engineering:

Analyze feature importance to select relevant features.
Create new features if needed based on domain knowledge.

3. Model Selection:

Choose appropriate binary classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

4. Model Training:

Train the selected models on the training dataset.
Perform hyperparameter tuning if required using techniques like grid search or random search.

5. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Use confusion matrices to understand model predictions.

6. Model Interpretation:

Interpret the model results to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition.

7. Deployment:

If the model meets the performance criteria, deploy it for real-world predictions.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, we aim to develop a robust binary classification model that can accurately predict employee attrition. This model can be valuable for HR departments and organizations to proactively address attrition-related issues and improve employee retention.
